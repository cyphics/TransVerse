* Story (flow of events)
Crash happens

Emergency console starts.

Diagnostic is ran. Not good.

Database corrupted. Can be recovered, but takes time and energy.

We need sustainable source of energy.
I have some plans for an emergency generator. But it must be built
from raw material.

We have a rudimentary 3D printer, but its firmware is corrupted and
must be rewritten.

Fire emacs.

*Unlocks creating softwares.*

Write first software. Flash it on 3D printer.

*Unlocks creating structures*

Load plans for emergency generator.

Requires *raw material* and time.

Once completed, it starts generating 1J/s.

*Unlocks generating energy* -> Joules

Energy can be used to start restoring databse.

Startup fails. Booloader corrupted. Must be rewritten.

Return to emacs. Write bootloader and flash it.

*Unlocks database* -> new plans (science)


* Implementation
** TODO Implement dependencies
** TODO Implement initial prices
